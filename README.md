In this repository, you will find three folders that include python code, data, and resulting images. Furthermore, these files are utilized to better understand the 2012 drought which was detrimental to the agriculture industry nationwide. As droughts are not a one day event, datasets were utilized to cover the start (May, 2012), peak (August, 2012), and ending (June, 2013) of the event. Three states that had major impacts were also utilized to narrow down the study region to analyze how impacts varied across states in the midwest. The code folder, has five different python files in which can be utilized to create surface maps, 500 mb (included in additional maps) and 850 mb maps (gridded data), soundings, and meteograms. MetPy has a lengthy but useful example code section on their website which was utilized to create the code for soundings and meteograms. The data included within this project came from various links which are included below. The GFS grib files were too large to incorporate into the repository, however the data can be downloaded from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) link. The resulting images for the code are also included to show what one can expect from utilizing this code for their respective projects.
